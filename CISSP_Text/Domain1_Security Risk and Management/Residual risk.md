Residual Risk is a risk that cannot be completely eliminated and remains even after measures such as product safety design and protective measures have been implemented.
This refers to a situation where there is still a possibility of some kind of accident or problem occurring, despite measures having been taken.

残留リスク（residual risk）とは、製品の安全設計や保護手段などの対策を講じた後でも、完全に排除できずに残ってしまうリスクのことです。
これは、対策が施されているにも関わらず、なおも何らかの事故や問題が発生する可能性が残る状態を指します。
