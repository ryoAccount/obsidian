The Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is the estimated frequency or likelihood that a particular risk event will occur within a one-year period.

年間発生率（ARO）とは、特定のリスクイベントが1年間に発生する可能性または頻度の推定値です。

---

*Number of Incidents / Number of Years = ARO* 

Example 1: If a security incident is expected to happen 5 times in a year, the ARO is 5. 
Example 2: If a data breach is expected to occur once every five years, the ARO is 1/5, or 0.2.
