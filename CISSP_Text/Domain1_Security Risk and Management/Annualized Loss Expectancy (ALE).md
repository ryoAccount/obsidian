The annualized loss expectancy is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the [[Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)]].

年間予想損失額は、1回あたりの損失予測額（SLE）に年間発生確率（ARO）を乗算して計算されます。

Example: 
If a single cyberattack is estimated to cost $50,000 (SLE) and is expected to occur 2 times a year (ARO), the ALE is $100,000 ($50,000 x 2).
